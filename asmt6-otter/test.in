%%% ==========================================
%%%  To run:  ~cs365/bin/otter < test.in > test.out

%%%  Be sure to look at "test.out" to see how OTTER "clausified"
%%%  the input formulae.

% Note:   This file is a stand-alone input file for otter.
%         It is _NOT_ intended to be used with the Makefile for Asst 4.
%       
%   That's why this file includes the NEGATED query 
%			-(exists z (Cool(z) & $ans(z)))
%   and the "end_of_list" statement.
%
%   In asst 4, you will type your knowledge base axioms in "kb.in"
%   (WITHOUT a query and WITHOUT an end_of_list).  You will type
%   separate queries (with "end_of_lists") in each of the query.in files.
